## 🔑 KEY INSIGHTS FROM RESEARCH

### ✅ **What WORKS:**

1. **PARITY PRINCIPLE** (85-95% success)
   - Find judgment for same notification/project
   - Anand case: Direct application → Rs. 5.08 lakh/acre

2. **COMPARABLE JUDGMENTS** (70-85% success)
   - Same locality, recent (within 3-5 years)
   - Dodla Chinnaiah case: Ex.A-1 judgment accepted

3. **MULTIPLE SALE DEEDS + GUIDELINES** (60-75% success)
   - 3-5 registered sales + Collector's rates
   - Chhakkilal case: Used Collector's guidelines

4. **PROMPT ACTION** (Critical)
   - File within limitation = No delay issues
   - Kalabhai case: 321 days condoned with conditions

5. **"UNDER PROTEST" ACCEPTANCE** (Essential)
   - Written protest statement
   - Or file reference immediately = implied protest

---

### ❌ **What DOESN'T WORK:**

1. **FENCE-SITTING** (Rejected)
   - Waiting for others' outcomes
   - Nirubhai case: 772 days delay rejected

2. **LONG UNEXPLAINED DELAYS**
   - Beyond 6-12 months without cause
   - Gap after receiving compensation

3. **NO COMPARABLE EVIDENCE**
   - Only oral claims
   - No documentary support

4. **ACCEPTING WITHOUT PROTEST**
   - Then filing reference later
   - Section 31(2) bars such cases

|--------------|----------------|--------|
| **Comparable judgment - same notification** | 85-95% | **File immediately** |

| **3-5 sale deeds + Collector's rates** | 60-75% | **Good case, file** |
