In the context of land acquisition cases under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (old law, applicable to pre-2014 acquisitions), condonation of delay (excusing late filing) for an application under Section 18 (reference to court for enhancement of compensation/market value or interest on delayed payment) is generally not granted.
Why Condonation Is Not Allowed for Section 18 Applications
The limitation period is strictly prescribed in the proviso to Section 18(2):
	•	If the applicant was present or represented when the award was made → within 6 weeks from the award date.
	•	Otherwise → within 6 weeks from receipt of notice under Section 12(2), or 6 months from the award date (whichever expires first).
Supreme Court judgments consistently hold that:
	•	The Land Acquisition Collector is not a court and lacks power to condone delay.
	•	Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963 (which allows condonation for “sufficient cause” in appeals/revisions) does not apply to Section 18 applications, as it is a special provision with its own strict timeline.
	•	Key rulings: Officer on Special Duty v. Shah Manilal Chandulal (1996) 9 SCC 414; related principles in Parsa Singh v. State of Punjab and others.
If the Section 18 application is filed late, the Collector must reject it as time-barred, and no reference can be made to the District Court.
Where Condonation May Be Granted
Condonation is possible in later stages of the same proceedings:
	1	Appeals from the Reference Court’s decision (under Section 54 of the 1894 Act) to the High Court or Supreme Court → Courts liberally apply Section 5 of the Limitation Act here, especially for landowners seeking enhancement (e.g., to ensure parity with others who got higher compensation). Examples: Pathapati Subba Reddy v. Special Deputy Collector (2024); Imrat Lal v. Land Acquisition Collector (where delay condoned for equity in similar cases).
	2	Execution proceedings or related writs → High Courts sometimes entertain delays under Article 226 (writ jurisdiction) for justice, but rarely override the initial Section 18 bar.
	3	For Section 28A applications (re-determination based on another’s enhanced award) → Limitation is 3 months from the court’s award; condonation is usually not allowed (strict like Section 18).
Under the New Law (Right to Fair Compensation Act, 2013)
If acquisition started after 01.01.2014, references go to the LARR Authority (Section 64). Limitation rules differ, and condonation may be more flexible in appeals, but strict for initial claims.
Advice: File the Section 18 application strictly within time to avoid rejection. If delayed due to lack of knowledge of the award/notice, argue “date of knowledge” (as in some old cases), but success is rare. Consult a local lawyer with your award details for case-specific options, like writ petition if there’s proven fraud/non-service of notice.
************************************
Extracted Details from Similar Decisions on Claim Petitions for Delayed Compensation in Land Acquisition
Based on the search on Indian Kanoon and related legal documents, I identified several judgments where claimants succeeded in claims for interest on delayed compensation, enhanced market value, solatium, and additional benefits under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 or the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 (LARR Act). Claim petitions (applications under Section 18 for reference to court) are rarely available in full PDF form publicly, as Indian Kanoon and similar sites primarily host judgments. However, judgments often quote or summarize the original claim petitions/applications, including grounds for enhancement and interest on delays. Below are key extractions from relevant documents/judgments (sourced from PDFs or pages where available), focusing on petition details, grounds for delayed compensation/interest claims, and successful outcomes:
	1	Sunder vs Union of India (2001, Supreme Court) - https://indiankanoon.org/doc/531626/
	◦	Summary from Judgment: The claimants filed applications under Section 18 seeking enhancement of compensation, including interest on solatium for delayed payments. Grounds: The original award undervalued the market value; possession was taken without prompt payment, triggering interest under Section 34 (9% p.a., escalating to 15% after one year). Claimants argued solatium (30% under Section 23(2)) forms part of compensation, entitling interest on the aggregate. The court held claimants succeeded, directing interest on solatium from the date of possession, clarifying retrospective application for pending cases. No full claim petition PDF extracted, but judgment quotes grounds like “inadequate compensation” and “delay in disbursement.”
	2	Gurpreet Singh vs Union of India (2006, Supreme Court) - https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1736128/
	◦	Summary from Judgment: Claimants’ petitions under Section 18 and appeals sought interest on enhanced compensation and solatium for delays in execution. Grounds: Non-payment post-award violated Sections 28 and 34; solatium must attract interest as per Sunder judgment. Claimants succeeded in prospective application from Sunder date, with courts awarding interest on solatium and excess amounts. Judgment summarizes petition prayers for “enhancement with statutory benefits including interest from possession date.”
	3	Union of India vs Tarsem Singh (2019, Supreme Court) - https://indiankanoon.org/doc/167999993/
	◦	Summary from Judgment: Under National Highways Act read with LA Act, claimants filed references/appeals claiming solatium and interest for delayed payments. Grounds: Arbitrary denial of benefits; delays post-possession entitled 15% p.a. interest under Section 34. Claimants succeeded, with court directing payment of solatium and interest, modifying prior orders for equity. Petition details include claims for “fair market value enhancement and interest on entire compensation due to protracted litigation.”
	4	Smt. Gangabayamma vs Special Land Acquisition Officer (High Court) - https://indiankanoon.org/doc/67583086/
	◦	Summary from Judgment: Claimant filed appeal after reference under Section 18. Grounds: Undervalued land (enhanced from original award to Rs.4,781/- per gunta); delay in payment warranted interest under Sections 28/34. Claimant succeeded in enhancement, with court awarding solatium and interest on delayed amounts. Judgment references petition’s objection to “arbitrary valuation” and prayer for “interest from possession date.”
	5	Rama Yallappa Bharmal vs Deputy Collector (High Court) - https://indiankanoon.org/doc/37657351/
	◦	Summary from Judgment: Petitioner claimed compensation for forcible acquisition without payment, treated as continuing wrong. Grounds: No due process; delay over 20 years entitled damages/interest at 15% p.a. Court held claimant succeeded, awarding compensation with interest despite delay, citing “continuing illegality.” Petition included prayer for “monetary compensation with 15% interest p.a.”
	6	Trivedi Janardan Ghanshyambhai vs Competent Authority (2025, High Court) - https://indiankanoon.org/doc/112624489/
	◦	Summary from Judgment: Writ petitions challenging awards under LARR Act, 2013 for omitting solatium (100%) and 12% additional compensation/interest. Grounds: Benefits under Sections 26-30 not included; delays post-notification. Claimants succeeded in directing inclusion of solatium and interest. Petition format emphasized “violation of fair compensation provisions.”
	7	From Sample Petition PDF (Scribd Document) - https://www.scribd.com/document/59582762/Petition-under-section-18-of-land-acquisition-act-to-get-enhancement-of-compensation
	◦	Extracted Draft Petition Text: (Limited extraction due to page restrictions; full draft not fully coherent in source, but key parts:) “In the matter of… Application under Section 18… The applicant objects to the award on grounds of inadequate market value… Claims enhancement based on comparable sales… Prayer: Refer to court for determination, award interest under Section 34 for delay.”
	8	From Writ Petition PDF Challenging Amendments (Bar and Bench) - https://images.assettype.com/barandbench/import/2018/12/Land-Acquisition-Ammendments-Challenge-WP-SC.pdf
	◦	Extracted Petition Details: Synopsis challenges state amendments diluting compensation/solatium/interest. Grounds: Violations of Articles 14/21; dilution of multiplying factors (e.g., rural 4x to 2x), removal of consent/SIA, extended delays without interest. Prayers: Strike down amendments; restore original compensation with interest. Relevant to claims: Emphasizes solatium (100% under LARR), 12% additional, and interest for delays.
	9	From Government Order PDF (Andhra Pradesh Higher Compensation) - https://environmentclearance.nic.in/writereaddata/online/EC/2002201757G4VLFTLandRelatedLetters.pdf
	◦	Extracted Details: Application for acquisition under LARR Act for airport; market value fixed (e.g., Rs.8,56,282/acre), multiplied by 1.25, 100% solatium, 12% interest for 274 days delay (total e.g., Rs.22,17,841/acre). Negotiated higher lumpsum (Rs.33,00,000/acre) approved under Section 28A. Grounds for higher claim: Unwillingness to accept standard; prolonged negotiations.
	10	From High Court Judgment PDF (WP No.9629/2009) - https://csis.tshc.gov.in/hcorders/2009/wp/wp_9629_2009.pdf
	◦	Extracted Judgment Text (Partial): Petitioners sought reference under Section 18 for enhancement, including omitted structures. Grounds: Awards omitted assets; delays in payment. Court discussed entitlement to solatium, additional market value, interest (6-7.5% equitable). Claimants succeeded in remand for enhancement, with interest from possession date. References similar OPs where compensation doubled with interest.
In successful cases, claimants typically succeeded on grounds of undervaluation, delays triggering Section 34 interest (9-15% p.a.), and inclusion of solatium. Petitions often cite comparable sales, development potential, and statutory delays.

IN THE MATTER OF LAND ACQUISITION UNDER THE LAND ACQUISITION ACT, 1894 / RIGHT TO FAIR COMPENSATION AND TRANSPARENCY IN LAND ACQUISITION, REHABILITATION AND RESETTLEMENT ACT, 2013
APPLICATION UNDER SECTION 18 OF THE LAND ACQUISITION ACT, 1894 FOR REFERENCE TO COURT FOR ENHANCEMENT OF MARKET VALUE AND INTEREST ON DELAYED COMPENSATION
To,
The Land Acquisition Officer / District Collector,
[District Name, State, e.g., Vizianagaram, Andhra Pradesh],
[Full Office Address].
Sir,
Synopsis:
The applicant seeks reference to the competent court for determination of fair market value of acquired land, enhancement of compensation, inclusion of solatium, additional market value, and interest on delayed payments, as the award is inadequate and undervalued. Based on comparable sales and development potential, the market value should be enhanced, with interest under Sections 34 and 28 for delays post-possession.
List of Dates:
	•	[Date]: Notification under Section 4/11 published.
	•	[Date]: Declaration under Section 6/19 issued.
	•	[Date]: Award No. [Number] passed, determining compensation at Rs. [Amount] per acre/sq.m.
	•	[Date]: Notice under Section 12(2)/equivalent received (or applicant present at award).
	•	[Date]: Possession taken without full payment, causing delay.
	•	[Current Date]: This application filed within limitation.
	1	That the applicant is [Full Name], aged [Age], residing at [Address], owner/interested in land [Survey/Plot No., Area, Village/Taluka/District], acquired vide Notification dated [Date] and Award dated [Date].
	2	That the applicant received notice of the award on [Date] and has not accepted the compensation of Rs. [Awarded Amount] without protest, as it undervalues the market value at the time of notification.
	3	That the grounds of objection are:
a. The market value is arbitrary and low (e.g., Rs. [Awarded Rate]/acre); actual value, based on recent sales (e.g., Sale Deed dated [Date] at Rs. [Higher Rate]), location (proximity to [highway/airport]), fertility, and potential (e.g., commercial use), is Rs. [Claimed Rate]/acre under Section 23(1).
b. Inadequate account for assets (crops, trees, structures, severance) under Section 23.
c. Delay in payment post-possession entitles interest at 9% p.a. (escalating to 15% after 1 year) under Section 34, plus on enhanced amount under Section 28.
d. Solatium (30% under 1894 Act / 100% under 2013 Act) and 12% additional under Section 23(1A)/equivalent not fully applied; claim interest on solatium as per Sunder vs UOI.
e. Negotiation for higher lumpsum (e.g., Rs. [Higher Amount]/acre as in Bhogapuram cases) if applicable.
f. Violation of fair compensation principles, causing hardship (reference Vidya Devi vs State for equitable interest).
	4	That no amount received without protest; matter requires reference for proper determination, including enhancement and costs.
	5	That application is within time under Section 18(2).
Prayer:
a. Refer the matter to the Principal Civil Court of Original Jurisdiction / District Court / LARR Authority for determination of market value, enhanced compensation, solatium, additional benefits, and interest on delayed payments.
b. Award costs and any other relief.

*************************************
Key Provisions Under the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 (RFCTLARR Act / 2013 Act)
The 2013 Act (effective from 01.01.2014) provides significantly higher benefits than the old Land Acquisition Act, 1894, especially for acquisitions initiated on or after that date. Key relevant provisions for delayed compensation claims and interest:
	•	Section 26-30: Determination of market value (higher of circle rate/guideline value or average sale price), factors (e.g., location, potential), 100% solatium (Section 30), and additional components per First/Second Schedules.
	•	Section 69(2): 12% per annum additional compensation on market value from date of preliminary notification (Section 11) till award or possession (whichever earlier).
	•	Section 72/80: Interest on excess/enhanced compensation or delayed payment – 9% p.a. for first year from possession date, escalating to 15% p.a. thereafter till payment/deposit.
	•	Section 77: Payment mode – direct bank deposit preferred; if disputed/refused, deposit with LARR Authority. Receipt under protest preserves right to challenge.
	•	Section 64: Any interested person dissatisfied with award (market value, solatium, interest, R&R) can apply in writing to Collector for reference to LARR Authority (not civil court).
Claimants frequently succeed in references/appeals for higher market value, full 100% solatium, 12% additional, and interest on delays (e.g., due to litigation or non-deposit post-possession).
Real Case Examples Where Claimants Succeeded (Under 2013 Act)
	1	Claimant vs Unknown (2018, LARR Authority, Bengaluru)
	◦	Reference under Section 64(1). Claimant succeeded in enhancement to Rs.8,624/- per sq.ft., plus 100% solatium (Section 30), 12% p.a. additional (Section 69(2)), and 9%/15% interest on excess from possession date (Sections 72/80). Grounds: Undervaluation; delays post-possession.
	◦	Judgment: https://indiankanoon.org/doc/180254108/
	2	Komalamma J vs Special Land Acquisition Officer (2025, Karnataka)
	◦	Reference under Sections 64 & 77(2). Claimants succeeded in enhanced compensation with apportionment, implying interest/solatium benefits under 2013 Act framework.
	◦	Judgment: https://indiankanoon.org/doc/11141688/
	3	Bipin Bihari Pradhan vs Special Land Acquisition Officer (2024, Orissa High Court)
	◦	Writ for R&R benefits and compensation delays. Court directed consideration under 2013 Act, including interest for deprivation.
	◦	Judgment: https://indiankanoon.org/doc/151532798/
Other cases under Section 24(2) transitions (old to new Act) often award 2013 benefits (including interest) where delays occurred without lapsing proceedings (per Indore Development Authority vs Manoharlal, 2020: https://indiankanoon.org/doc/49625991/).
Full original applications/references are rarely public PDFs (administrative filings), but judgments summarize grounds/prayers similar to below.
Sample Application for Reference to LARR Authority (Under Section 64 of 2013 Act)
Note: This is a generic draft for acquisitions under the 2013 Act. File in writing with the Collector within 6 months from award date (or knowledge, if not served). Collector refers to Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (LARR) Authority (established under Section 51; usually presided by District Judge or equivalent). Attach award copy, evidence (sale deeds, valuation reports), and proof of protest (if partial payment received). Consult a lawyer; state rules may prescribe formats.

	2	The applicant received the award/notice on [Date] (or was present). The compensation awarded (Rs. [Amount]) has not been accepted without protest, as it is inadequate and does not comply with Sections 26-30.
	3	Grounds of Dissatisfaction:
a. Market value determined is arbitrary and low (Rs. [Awarded Rate]); actual value based on comparable sales (e.g., Sale Deed dated [Date] at Rs. [Higher Rate]), location advantages, and potential is Rs. [Claimed Rate] per unit (Section 26).
b. Full 100% solatium not properly applied (Section 30).
c. 12% per annum additional compensation from notification date omitted/inadequate (Section 69(2)).
d. Delay in payment post-possession (taken on [Date]) entitles interest at 9% p.a. for first year, escalating to 15% p.a. thereafter on entire amount (including excess/enhanced) till payment (Section 80).
e. Rehabilitation & Resettlement entitlements (First/Second Schedule) not fully awarded.
f. Other factors (crops, trees, structures, severance) undervalued.
	4	No amount received without protest. This application is within limitation.
Prayer:
Refer the matter to the Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Authority under Section 64 for determination of fair market value, enhanced compensation, 100% solatium, 12% additional, interest on delayed payment, R&R benefits, and costs.
