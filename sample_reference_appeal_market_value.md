### 2. GROUNDS OF OBJECTION TO THE AWARD

The Applicant(s) object(s) to the Award on the following grounds:

#### A. UNDERVALUATION OF LAND

2.1 **Inadequate Market Value:** The Land Acquisition Officer has erroneously and arbitrarily determined the market value of the acquired land at Rs. _________ per acre/hectare, which is far below the actual prevailing market value of similar lands in the locality.

2.2 **Ignoring Comparable Sales:** The LAO has failed to consider genuine comparable sale instances of similar lands in the vicinity sold for much higher prices around the relevant time.

2.3 **Potential and Location Ignored:** The LAO has not taken into consideration the superior locational advantages, potentiality, and special features of the acquired land, namely:
   - The land is situated abutting [main road / highway / panchayat road]
   - The land is at a distance of only _____ meters/kms from [important landmark/town/market]
   - The land has direct access to [specify: electricity, water supply, drainage, etc.]
   - The land is in close proximity to [schools/hospitals/commercial establishments]
   - The land has potential for [residential/commercial/industrial] development

2.4 **Income Potential Ignored:** The LAO has failed to properly assess the income derived from the land, which was Rs. _________ per annum from [crops cultivated / rental income / etc.].

2.5 **Collector's Guidelines:** The LAO has ignored the Collector's Guidelines/Circle Rates/Jantri Rates for stamp duty valuation prevalent in the area, which fixed the value at Rs. _________ per acre/hectare.

---

#### B. ERRORS IN LAO'S DETERMINATION

   - Too remote in time from the date of Section 4(1) notification
   - Involving lands of inferior quality and location
   - Not properly verified or authenticated

2.7 **Arbitrary Deductions:** The LAO has made arbitrary and unjustified deductions on account of [specify: development charges, location, etc.] without any basis.

2.8 **Non-Compliance with Principles:** The Award violates the established principles of market value determination laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in:
   - Collector, Land Acquisition v. Mst. Katiji (1987) 2 SCC 107
   - Administrator General of West Bengal v. Collector, Varanasi (2013) 3 SCC 476
   - [Other relevant case laws]

- Remarks: [Same locality, similar land features, same project, etc.]

**Comparable Case 2:**

---

#### D. STATUTORY BENEFITS NOT PROPERLY CALCULATED

2.11 The LAO has also erred in calculation/non-grant of:
   - Solatium under Section 23(2) at 30% of market value
   - Additional amount under Section 23(1A) at 12% per annum
   - Interest under Section 28 / Section 34
   - [Any other statutory benefits]

---

### 3. GROUNDS FOR REFERENCE

### 2. GROUNDS OF APPEAL

**The impugned Judgment and Decree dated _________ passed by the learned [Court below] in L.A.C. No. _____ of 20___ is illegal, arbitrary, perverse, and contrary to law, and liable to be set aside on the following among other grounds:**

---

#### GROUND A: INADEQUATE ENHANCEMENT

2.1 The learned Reference Court has erred in law and on facts in determining the market value at only Rs. _________ per acre, which is grossly inadequate, unjust, and not in consonance with the prevailing market rates.

2.2 The Court below failed to properly appreciate the comparable sale instances (Ex. A-1, A-2, A-3) which clearly established market value at Rs. _________ per acre.

---

#### GROUND B: IGNORING SUPERIOR EVIDENCE

2.3 The Court below committed grave error in ignoring/not giving due weightage to the judgment in [Case Name], [Citation], wherein lands in the same locality under the same notification were awarded compensation at Rs. _________ per acre.

2.4 The principle of parity demands that the Appellant, whose land is similarly situated (or better situated), should not be discriminated against and should be awarded equal or higher compensation.

---

#### GROUND C: ERRONEOUS REJECTION OF EVIDENCE

2.5 The Court below erred in rejecting the evidence of PW-1, PW-2, etc., which clearly established the superior locational advantages and potentiality of the acquired land, namely:
   - [Specify: road frontage, proximity to town, commercial potential, etc.]

2.6 The Court below failed to appreciate that the acquired land is more advantageously situated compared to the lands in comparable instances, being:
   - [Distance from main road / market / town]
   - [Better accessibility, infrastructure, amenities]
   - [Higher development potential]

---

#### GROUND D: TIME ESCALATION NOT GRANTED

2.7 The Court below failed to grant appropriate escalation for time lag between the comparable sale instances / comparable judgments and the date of Section 4(1) notification in the present case.

2.8 There is a time gap of _____ years between the comparable case [Ex. A-1] and the present case, which warrants escalation at the rate of _____% per annum, but the same was not granted.

---

#### GROUND E: PURPOSE OF ACQUISITION IGNORED

2.9 The Court below failed to appreciate that the purpose of acquisition itself [e.g., house sites, commercial complex, industrial park] indicates the high potentiality and development value of the land.

2.10 The very fact that the Government selected this particular land for [stated purpose] is proof of its superior location and value.

---

#### GROUND F: COLLECTOR'S GUIDELINES

2.11 The Court below erred in not considering the Collector's Guidelines / Jantri Rates / Circle Rates for the area, which fixed the value at Rs. _________ per acre for the relevant period.

2.12 As held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in **Lal Chand v. Union of India, AIR 2010 SC 170**, Collector's Guidelines can be a reliable piece of evidence for determining market value.

---

#### GROUND G: ERRORS IN LAW

   - **Collector, Land Acquisition v. Mst. Katiji (1987) 2 SCC 107**

---

#### GROUND I: COMPARABLE JUDGMENT IN SAME LOCALITY (PARITY PRINCIPLE)

2.16 In the case of [Name] vs. [Name], reported in [Citation] / decided vide judgment dated _________ in [Appeal No. / Case No.], this Hon'ble High Court awarded compensation at Rs. _________ per acre for lands situated in [same village / nearby village] under the same notification / same project.

2.17 The said judgment is directly applicable to the present case as:
   - Same locality (Village _________, Taluk _________)
   - Same notification date / Same project
   - Same acquiring authority
   - Similar land characteristics
   - [Or] The Appellant's land has superior advantages compared to the lands in that case

2.18 The doctrine of equal treatment and non-discrimination enshrined in Article 14 of the Constitution mandates that the Appellant should be awarded compensation at par with the judgment cited above.

2.19 The Court below erred in not following the said precedent/parity.

---

### 3. RELIEF SOUGHT
