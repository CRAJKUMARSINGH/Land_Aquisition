   - Greater potentiality for house sites
   - Evidence: P.W-2 testified lands at 1 furlong distance from Ex.A-1 lands

- Enhancement by Reference Court was confirmed by High Court in Ex.A-1

### Court's Final Decision:
- Enhancement to Rs. 45,000/- per acre justified
- Just and reasonable compensation
- No interference warranted
- Appeal by LAO dismissed

## REJECTION CASE: Nirubhai Bhurabhai vs SLAO
**Citation:** Gujarat HC, C/CA/4468/2024, Order dated 04/08/2025  
**URL:** https://indiankanoon.org/doc/193253261/  
**Status:** DELAY CONDONATION REJECTED

### Why Application Failed:
✗ Delay of 772 days (over 2 years)  
✗ Certified copy obtained on 30.10.2020, appeal filed 03.08.2024  
✗ Compensation received on 04.07.2023, no action for 1+ year  
✗ "Fence-sitter" conduct - waited for other claimants' outcomes  
✗ Could have used Order 33 CPC for indigent person status  
✗ No explanation for gap between receiving compensation and filing appeal  
✗ Poverty alone not sufficient cause

### Court's Observation:
*"Once it is held that a party has lost his right to have the matter considered on merits because of his own inaction for a long, it cannot be presumed to be non-deliberate delay."*

## CONCLUSION

The research reveals that Indian courts adopt a **liberal approach** toward:
- Condonation of delay (when genuine cause shown)
- Interpretation of limitation provisions (knowledge principle)
- Acceptance under protest (substantial justice)
- Market value determination (comparable evidence)

However, courts reject applications showing:
- **Willful inaction** or "fence-sitting"
- **Unexplained long delays** (beyond 6-12 months)
- **Lack of diligence** in pursuing rights
- **Absence of documentary support** for claims

**Success Rate Factors:**
- Prompt action after knowledge: HIGH success
- Documented financial hardship: MODERATE success
- Comparable judgment evidence: HIGH success
- Parity claims (same notification): VERY HIGH success
- Superior land advantages proof: HIGH success
